# EVA: An Open-Domain Chinese Dialogue System with Large-Scale Generative Pre-Training

## 1 Introduction

EVA is an open-domain Chinese pre-trained model, which contains the largest Chinese dialogue model with 2.8B parameters and is pre-trained on WDC-Dialogue, including 1.4B Chinese dialogue data from different domains. Our paper, data, codes and model parameters will be released soon.

## 2 Dataset

We construct a dataset named **WDC-Dialogue** from Chinese social media to train EVA. Specifically, conversations from various sources are gathered and a rigorous data cleaning pipeline is designed to enforce the quality of WDC-Dialogue. We mainly focus on three categories of textual interaction data, i.e., **repost** on social media, **comment** / **reply** on various online forums and online **question and answer (Q\&A)** exchanges. Each round of these textual interactions yields a dialogue session via well-designed parsing rules. The following table shows a statistics of the filtered WDC-Dialogue dataset and other Chinese dialogue datasets.

## 3 Model

**EVA** is a Transformer-based dialogue model with a bi-directional encoder and a uni-directional decoder. We present the EVA's model details and a comparison with previous large-scale Chinese pre-trained dialogue models in the following table.

The model can be downloaded in BAAI's repository. The downloaded folder should have the following structure:

```[bash]
eva/
├── 222500
│   └── mp_rank_00_model_states.pt
├── latest_checkpointed_iteration.txt
```

## 4 Experiment

We compare EVA with Chinese pre-trained models including [CDial-GPT](https://github.com/thu-coai/CDial-GPT) and [CPM](https://github.com/TsinghuaAI/CPM). Results in the automatic evaluation including uni-gram F1, ROUGE-L, BLEU-4 and distinct n-grams are shown as follows:

We also present an example of multi-turn generation results in the interactive human evaluation:

## 5 Run the Code

We provide the inference code of EVA. The source code is provided in `src/`.

### 5.1 Environment

For convience, please use the docker we provide to setup the environment:

```[bash]
docker pull gyxthu17/eva:1.0
```

Since the environment is ready in the docker, you don't need to set any environmental variables. You may need to mount this directory to a directory in the docker. For example, to mount to /mnt, run the following code to run the docker image:

```[bash]
docker run -ti -v ${PWD}:/mnt gyxthu17/eva:1.0 /bin/bash
```

### 5.2 Run

Before running the code, please change WORKING_DIR in the script to the path of this EVA directory, change `CKPT_PATH` to the path where the pre-trained weights are stored. You also need to change node-0 `${WORKING_DIR}/src/configs/host_files/hostfile` to the ssh node name (or IP) where you run distributed training. Please refer to DeepSpeed for more detailed information of this configuration.


Run the following command:
```
cd src/
bash scripts/infer_enc_dec_interactive.sh
```

After running the command, please firstly make sure the pre-trained weights are load. If they are loaded, the log printed to the stdout should contain messages like `successfully loaded /path-to-checkpoint/eva/mp_rank_01_model_states.pt`. Otherwise, `WARNING: could not find the metadata file /***/latest_checkpointed_iteration.txt will not load any checkpoints and will start from random` will display. Note that when you successfully load the model, you will see messages like `The following zero checkpoints paths are missing: ['/path-to-checkpoint/eva/200000/zero_pp_rank_0_mp_rank_00_optim_states.pt',...` which mean optimizer states are not loaded. This **DOES NOT** affect the use of model inference and you can just ignore it.

If things go well, you will eventually enter an interactive interface. Have fun talking to EVA!
